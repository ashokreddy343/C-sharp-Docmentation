Part 1 - C# Tutorial - Introduction
	Purpose of Main() method - Main method is the entry point into your application
Part 2 - C# Tutorial - Reading and writing to a console 
Part 3 - C# Tutorial - Built-in types 
	1.Boolean type - Oly true or false
	2.Integral Types -sbyte,byte,short,ushort,int,unint,long,ulong,char
	3.Floating Types - float and double
	4.Decimal Types
	5.String Type
Part 4 - C# Tutorial - String type 
Part 5 - C# Tutorial - Common Operators 
	1.Assignment Operator=
	2.Arithmetic Operators like +,-,*,/,%
	3.Comparison Operators like ==, !=,>, >=, <, <= 
	4.Conditional Operators like &&, ||
	5.Ternary Operator ?:
	6.Null Coalescing Operator ??  
Part 6 - C# Tutorial - Nullable Types 
	1.Value Types  - int, float, double, structs, enums etc
	2.Reference Types â€“ Interface, Class, delegates, arrays etc
	nullable types
		int? j=0(j is nullable)
Part 7 - C# Tutorial - Datatype conversions
	Implicit conversions
		1.Implicit conversion is done by the compiler
		2.When there is no loss of information if the conversion is done
		3.if there is no possibility of throwing exceptions during the conversion
		4.Ex:int to float will not loose any data
	Explicit Conversions
	Difference between Parse and TryParse
		1.If the number is in a string format you have 2 options - Parse() and TryParse() 		
		2.Parse() method throws an exception if it cannot parse the value,whereas 
		  TryParse() returns a bool indicating whether it succeeded or failed.
		3.Use Parse() if you are sure the value will be valid, otherwise use TryParse() 

Part 8 - C# Tutorial - Arrays in C#
	1.An array is a collection of similar data types
	2.int[] EvenNumbers = new int[3];
	3.int[] OddNumbers = { 1, 3, 5}; //Initialize and assign values in the same line	
	Advantages
		Arrays are strongly typed
	Disadvantages
		1.Arrays cannot grow in size once initialized
		2.Have to rely on integral indices to store or retrieve items from the array. 

Part 9 - C# Tutorial - Comments
	1. Single line comments -//
	2. Multi line comments /* */
	3. Introduction to XML documentation comments  -///
