Factory Method Design Pattern - C#
	1.The factory method design pattern abstract the process of object 
	  creation and allows the object to be created at run-time when it is required.
	2.Factory method pattern falls under Creational Pattern of Gang of Four (GOF) 
	  Design Patterns in .Net.	
	3.It is used to create objects
	4.People usually use this pattern as the standard way to create objects.

What is Factory Method Pattern?
	1.In Factory pattern, we create the object without exposing the creation logic
	2.In this pattern, an interface is used for creating an object, 
	  but let subclass decide which class to instantiate
	3.The creation of object is done when it is required.
	4.The Factory method allows a class later instantiation to subclasses.
	5.In short, factory method design pattern abstract the process of object 
	  creation and allows the object to be created at run-time when it is required
When to use it?
	1.Subclasses figure out what objects should be created
	2.Parent class allows later instantiation to subclasses means
	  the creation of an object is done when it is required	
	3.The process of objects created is required to centralize within the application
